In our first inquiry, we had someone perform some tasks using FirstClass while we took observations on what they did. Our interviewee was a freshman (who we’ll refer to as Bob) who has been at Horace Mann and has been using FirstClass since 6th grade(3 years of experience). The interview was on the second floor of the library, where it was mostly quiet. We asked Bob to open the app and do what he would usually do upon opening the app. Afterwards we asked him to send an email with a file attached, forward an email, and view/download a file from an email.
From the inquiry we learned that someone who has been using the platform for a while can do most operations in the app without much thought, while a new user may have to spend time looking for things on the platform. For example, the mailbox, which, for Bob, is the function he uses most in FirstClass, has a tiny link that the user needs to click on in order to open it. Bob clicked on this link nearly instantly after the page loaded and knew exactly where to find it. A new user may have to spend some time looking for smaller signifiers in the app, which may waste time for someone unfamiliar with the app.
Overall, the app was slow compared to other email platforms. Opening new emails took more time than it should have, and downloading and attaching a .pdf file was extremely slow. Another problem that we identified was if an email was deleted. If someone were to send an email and then delete it, the person who received the email would still see it in their mailbox. After opening the email, an error message would pop up, and the recipient would have to re-open their mailbox. Only then would the email be deleted from their system. This could waste a lot of time if a user had multiple deleted emails in their mailbox. 
However, we also identified some functions in FirstClass that are very helpful, which were the autocomplete system and “next unread” button that FirstClass has. When entering an email address to a recipient, FirstClass can find users with a Horace Mann email if a user just searches their name. If someone does not know the full name of their teacher, they can find their email address using this function. If a user is viewing an email, they can quickly see their next email that is marked unread by hitting the “next” unread button. Both functions can saved a lot of time for Bob.
Overall, the process that we took to gather information was very smooth. In the future, we can try to establish a more natural environment for users to use the app in. The “interview” style may not be the most effective for this because someone may feel uncomfortable or pressured with someone taking notes on their behavior while using the app. We might try to do improved interviews and also surveys and questionnaires for future inquiries.
