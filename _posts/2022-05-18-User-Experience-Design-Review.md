# HM Interconnected 

Presented By:
* Ren - UI Designer
* Pavan - UI Designer
* Luke - UI Designer

### 1. Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview

The problem that our group identified was Horace Mann’s email system, FirstClass. FirstClass is used daily by students and teachers alike and from our personal experience and time with the community, there are obvious issues with the system. Such issues can and will cause communication errors between members of the community, and because the platform is used so often those problems should be fixed as soon as possible. Our solution was to make an entirely new app. It would be more user-friendly and easier to learn how to use, and in addition to fixing the main errors of FirstClass it would also integrate many new features. These features include a direct messaging function for easier communication, a Slack tab for managing after-school clubs, a Google Classroom tab for managing schoolwork and an announcements window for more important emails and messages.


### Final Paper Prototype and Initial Digital Mockup

IMAGE(S): PAPER PROTOTYPE 

INITIAL MOCK UP: N/A

2 Critical Tasks:
1. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)
2. Finding/Viewing Past Emails

Critical Aspects of Design:
1. The clear, consistent navigation system
2. The feedback messages that ensure user-trust 
3. The flexibility and accessibility of information through widgets + notifications + pop ups + previews


### Digital Mockup & Testing Results

EMBED: FIGMA DIGITAL PROTOTYPE 
 
2 Critical Tasks:
#### 1. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)

With our final prototype of the Interconnections App, users can communicate with each other through announcement emails, formal teacher-student emails, informal direct messaging, and club slack channels.
 
ANNOUNCEMENTS/NOTIFICATIONS: 
* To see an urgent announcement, a user will get a notification sent directly to their phone that will preview the alert. They can also click on this notification to launch the app to read more, or open the app normally to read the alert in the mail page of the Interconnections App. 

FORMAL EMAILING:
* To send a formal email to a teacher, student, or colleague, a user can launch the app and click directly on the mail icon or the customizable mail widget on the home page. From there, they can check emails sent to them, as well as send a new one using the standard “write-email” button in the bottom right corner. 

INFORMAL DIRECT MESSAGING:
* To informally direct message a colleague or fellow student, a user can click on the “DM” title on the top of the mail page, which will then swipe them into their DMing menu. From there, the user can use the DM page to find any HM community member via search at the top, and text using standard texting procedures. 

CLUB ORGANIZING: 
* A club leader can organize their meetings anytime through the forum-like club slack. There is no need to get approved to send out an email. Club leaders can also plan meetings through the club organizing page found on the forms/other page. 
 
#### 2. Finding/Viewing Past Emails

Interconnections App also allows users to find information about important events or club meetings. 

VIEWING EVENT INFO (VIA EMAIL):
* Users can find important information from past emails, saved underneath the mail page accessed by the mail icon. Finding past emails is seamless with the new custom search engine that filters emails via key-terms, recipients, and association. The filter can see through any spelling or typing errors. Emails will always be accessible to the user since they are saved to their account. 

CLUB ANNOUNCEMENTS
* If the user wishes to find out information about a club, team, or publication, they can navigate to the slack icon on the bottom of their screen, labeled clubs in case the user isn’t already familiar with the slack icon. From there they can quickly see the next meeting time for the extracurricular and can click on the title to enlarge the chat.
 

### OUR CHANGES FROM PAPER → DIGITAL
A NEW HELP PAGE 
* A pop-out help menu is in the top right corner of all pages of Interconnections App. This page is interactive and consistent, with a clear search bar on the top. This page will help the user as they adjust to the new app, and popular searches will be saved and then used to lead future updates of the app.

CUSTOMIZABLE HOME PAGE WIDGETS
* The home page of our app is fully customizable to show easy previews/access to the users most needed apps. This helps to accommodate the wide range of HM users (ex. allowing a student to display their coursework/clubs whilst a staff member could devote space to their calendar/emails)

SLACK “CLUBS” LABEL
* We added clarity to the Slack page icon since many members of the community are not yet familiar with the slack logo.

LOGIN BUTTON ADDED
* To reduce user anxiety, we added a clear “Login” button to the login page, allowing the user to submit their username + password when ready.

SAVE DRAFT BUTTON / EXIT BUTTONS
* We made sure to provide multiple paths for exit, whether that be large, clickable “x”s on each individual task, allowing for users to click off to the side when in a pop up, and always making the classic bottom bar navigation accessible.
