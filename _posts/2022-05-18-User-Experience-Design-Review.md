## 3. Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview

![crepe](/assets/img/section3.jpg)

The problem that our group identified was Horace Mann’s email system, FirstClass. FirstClass is used daily by students and teachers alike and from our personal experience and time with the community, there are obvious issues with the system. Such issues can and will cause communication errors between members of the community, and because the platform is used so often those problems should be fixed as soon as possible. Our solution was to make an entirely new app. It would be more user-friendly and easier to learn how to use, and in addition to fixing the main errors of FirstClass it would also integrate many new features. These features include a direct messaging function for easier communication, a Slack tab for managing after-school clubs, a Google Classroom tab for managing schoolwork and an announcements window for more important emails and messages.

## 4. Contextual Inquiry Results & Key Tasks

<img src="/assets/img/section4.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>


For our contextual inquiries we sent out a school-wide survey for faculty, students, and teachers, and also interviewed a teacher and a student at Horace Mann. The process of interviewing didn’t change at all throughout the two tests, but we had many drafts for our survey before we finally sent it out. Deciding the central tasks to accomplish was simple as many of the participants in the survey and the two that we interviewed had similar problems with FirstClass.

## 5. Initial Paper Prototype

![crepe](/assets/img/IMG_3187.JPG)

Our paper prototype, as given by the label, is a model of our application in paper format. Our application, as described before, focuses on making communication much easier between Horace Mann students. The tasks that we would pose to our testers was to send an email, and to check the upcoming meeting time for the Game Jam Club. On the main page of the paper prototype, there’s a google classroom widget to display upcoming assignments, a slack widget for club related things, and a small email/direct messaging widget to display unread emails to the user. On the bottom, there are icons for navigating the different functionalities of the application. The Slack functionality is primarily used for communication and information about club related things. Students can see upcoming club meeting dates and/or communicate with fellow club members on this functionality. The email functionality is primarily used for email between students and teachers, much like other email softwares. The google classroom functionality displays upcoming assignments, and allows students to turn in assignments etc. The settings page allows for the user to see their faculty/student profile and to get help with managing their preferences. 


## 6. Usability Testing Process & Results

Our testing process consisted of getting our peers to utilize our paper prototype of our applications. In total, we asked 3 people to test our paper prototype. We asked one of our classmates, the teacher of our class, and someone from the robotics club. Getting perspectives from people who are really experienced with First Class and its flaws helped us see if our application really solved those flaws, and provided them with a better communication system. After each test with one of our testers, we learned about more specific questions or tasks that could be posed to testers. The more pointed the question, the better of an idea we got on how to augment our own applications with tweaks or fixes. We posed tasks to our testers with the rationale of giving them tasks that would be the most integral to any potential users of our application. Tasks such as sending an email or finding out the meeting date of an extracurricular club are tasks that would be performed most often with our application, and thus we posed those tasks to our testers, to see if those tasks were as easy/intuitive as possible.


## 7. Final Paper Prototype and Initial Digital Mockup

INITIAL MOCK UP: N/A

2 Critical Tasks:
1. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)
2. Finding/Viewing Past Emails

Critical Aspects of Design:
1. The clear, consistent navigation system
2. The feedback messages that ensure user-trust 
3. The flexibility and accessibility of information through widgets + notifications + pop ups + previews


## 8. Digital Mockup & Testing Results

[EMBED: FIGMA DIGITAL PROTOTYPE](https://www.figma.com/proto/m4w59WibEZY5lsz1LsHi29/Mobile-Hi-Fi-Prototype?node-id=14%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=14%3A3) 
 
2 Critical Tasks:
#### 1. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)

With our final prototype of the Interconnections App, users can communicate with each other through announcement emails, formal teacher-student emails, informal direct messaging, and club slack channels.
 
ANNOUNCEMENTS/NOTIFICATIONS: 
* To see an urgent announcement, a user will get a notification sent directly to their phone that will preview the alert. They can also click on this notification to launch the app to read more, or open the app normally to read the alert in the mail page of the Interconnections App. 

FORMAL EMAILING:
* To send a formal email to a teacher, student, or colleague, a user can launch the app and click directly on the mail icon or the customizable mail widget on the home page. From there, they can check emails sent to them, as well as send a new one using the standard “write-email” button in the bottom right corner. 

INFORMAL DIRECT MESSAGING:
* To informally direct message a colleague or fellow student, a user can click on the “DM” title on the top of the mail page, which will then swipe them into their DMing menu. From there, the user can use the DM page to find any HM community member via search at the top, and text using standard texting procedures. 

CLUB ORGANIZING: 
* A club leader can organize their meetings anytime through the forum-like club slack. There is no need to get approved to send out an email. Club leaders can also plan meetings through the club organizing page found on the forms/other page. 
 
#### 2. Finding/Viewing Past Emails

Interconnections App also allows users to find information about important events or club meetings. 

VIEWING EVENT INFO (VIA EMAIL):
* Users can find important information from past emails, saved underneath the mail page accessed by the mail icon. Finding past emails is seamless with the new custom search engine that filters emails via key-terms, recipients, and association. The filter can see through any spelling or typing errors. Emails will always be accessible to the user since they are saved to their account. 

CLUB ANNOUNCEMENTS
* If the user wishes to find out information about a club, team, or publication, they can navigate to the slack icon on the bottom of their screen, labeled clubs in case the user isn’t already familiar with the slack icon. From there they can quickly see the next meeting time for the extracurricular and can click on the title to enlarge the chat.
 

#### OUR CHANGES FROM PAPER → DIGITAL
A NEW HELP PAGE 
* A pop-out help menu is in the top right corner of all pages of Interconnections App. This page is interactive and consistent, with a clear search bar on the top. This page will help the user as they adjust to the new app, and popular searches will be saved and then used to lead future updates of the app.

CUSTOMIZABLE HOME PAGE WIDGETS
* The home page of our app is fully customizable to show easy previews/access to the users most needed apps. This helps to accommodate the wide range of HM users (ex. allowing a student to display their coursework/clubs whilst a staff member could devote space to their calendar/emails)

SLACK “CLUBS” LABEL
* We added clarity to the Slack page icon since many members of the community are not yet familiar with the slack logo.

LOGIN BUTTON ADDED
* To reduce user anxiety, we added a clear “Login” button to the login page, allowing the user to submit their username + password when ready.

SAVE DRAFT BUTTON / EXIT BUTTONS
* We made sure to provide multiple paths for exit, whether that be large, clickable “x”s on each individual task, allowing for users to click off to the side when in a pop up, and always making the classic bottom bar navigation accessible.

## 9. Discussion & Implementation Plan

The final paper prototype showing was very limited and the feedback that we received wasn’t very helpful because we had planned to replace the paper prototype with a digital prototype. Unfortunately, this final showing was mostly pointless.

We set up a repository, but stopped there due to a lack of experience with the application. Unfortunately we didn’t have enough time at the end of the school year to learn how to use Xcode in its entirety, but we were able to experiment with the beginner-friendly storyboard function to play around with how a real iOS app could be developed. 

To finish our project, we would need to be sponsored by Dr. Kelly and given a larger and more experienced team to assist us. From there we would pool our new feedback from our mockup with our previous research to replicate our idea onto the program, and then would make it available to download on the App Store, and later Android devices using Android Studio.

Having many different models over two platforms — one physical and one digital — was very beneficial to our design process because we didn’t stay too attached to our mistakes. We were able to approach and fix problems faster by using both Figma and paper for prototypes. I think the current amount of iterations we have is a solid amount - any more would be too much but any less would be too little. I think that if our group was more experienced with XCode we could have made the app functional and successfully released it for public use.
