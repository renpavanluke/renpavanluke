## OUR REVISED TASKS

### 1. Viewing Emails on Time (notifications, unread)
**Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Checking emails is the most fundamental function of an email system, and is quite simple in FirstClass. A user will simply go to their mailbox and click on the desired email. There is also a “next unread” function which will send a user to their next unread email. However, 56.4% of users described having problems reading emails on time and receiving notification. This, in reality, should be an easier task, and the data collected in the survey may be due to human error, not the interface of FirstClass.


### 2. Launching the Application
** Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Users launch FirstClass constantly throughout everyday, yet a shocking 42.5% of our surveyees described struggling to do so. When launching the application, a user should tap on the app icon, type in their username and password, and then type in the mail.horacemann.org server ID. The average consistent user should have the mail server ID saved on their computer as well, which helps to streamline the process. We noted this was Easy-Medium, although this should be the easiest task in the process.


### 3. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)
** Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Sending emails is arguably the most important element of FirstClass, which thankfully seems to run relatively smoothly. 80% of students surveyed reported that they could easily find emails for people they needed to contact, and only 14.7% of users struggled to contact others on FirstClass. However, our resident interviewed teacher struggled a lot with emailing others, feeling that since he used the email function so often he had issues more often. He detailed not being able to send important emails and therefore not trusting that his emails would be received constantly. Currently sending an email works by selecting the mail icon, pressing “new” under another mail icon, typing in your subject, recipient, and cc, and then typing your message. You can send an email with the icon on the top left. 

	
### 4. Attaching/Opening Files to Emails
** Difficulty: Medium

Quite frequently, a user may need to attach a file to an email or open an attached file. This file might be homework, directions for an assignment, or an assessment, so it’s quite important to have a reliable email system so these files don’t get lost through sending. To attach a file, a user will find the button with a link icon, and simply upload their file. According to our survey, 45.8% of participants find that they have issues with sending or receiving files. A frequent problem for some users was that the files attached to an email couldn’t be viewed by the reader, so most of the time the issue isn’t attaching the files, but sending them. Contextual Inquiry-ee Bob also noted that opening new emails took more time than it should have, and downloading and attaching a .pdf file was extremely slow. 


### 5. Finding/Viewing Past Emails
** Difficulty: Hard

82 percent of users had issues with finding past emails. If you want to find a previously viewed email, the best way to find it would be to search the sender of the email’s name in the search bar of your mailbox. For a new user, this isn’t obscure, but for someone who isn’t very experienced with technology it might be confusing to locate the search bar. Also, this isn’t very effective because a user may remember the contents of an email, not the sender. Furthermore, FirstClass has a function which auto-deletes emails after a month in order to save space. Deleted emails are saved in the “trash” section for another month, and are then lost forever. So, it would be impossible to find an email from 2 months or longer ago. 90% of users didn’t find this function useful, and many instead said that it was rather annoying. Contextual Inquiry-ee Bob also struggled with this auto-deleting feature.


### 6. Fixing Problems 
** Difficulty: Hard

When things with FirstClass do not go smoothly (which happens to 62% of users at least once a week), it’s essential that a user can find out how to get help and continue on with the application effortlessly. Currently, if you had a problem with FirstClass you could contact someone from the Tech Department or go on the UD Student Life Page and access the FirstClass section. However, this is hard to access because a user could not know anyone on the Tech team, and the FirstClass page on the UD Student Life page only has one resource, which is a brief google doc link. This makes help extremely difficult, especially for newer students who might not have access to a wide range of knowledge on how to get help.


## DESIGN 1: FirstClass Resource Page

![crepe](/assets/img/rendesign.jpg)

The FirstClass Resource Page is a collection of videos, forums, and resources that can help an experienced or new Horace Mann student/staff member/teacher navigate FirstClass and get into contact with other community members. The first page has a general how-to guide for using FirstClass for the first time, detailing how to log into your account, launch and download the application, and more with student-made video guides. Pages 2 and 4 help users to contact others, allowing them to find emails for members and how to contact them as well as a page dedicated to seamless interaction between clubs and publications through Slack Channels. Page 3 allows students/teachers to submit permission to make an announcement to the whole school or a significant portion of the school. Pages 5 + 6 allow for users to get help with FirstClass and help each other with their day-to-day issues. On the top of all pages, important announcements cycle through so that notifications can be well communicated. Also in the top of most pages there is a mail icon showing how many unread messages there are in your inbox.


This Design allows users to: 
* Fixing Problems (pgs. 5-6) - The help forums + calendar sign-up pages allow for users to get help for their various issues. All they have to do is click on the page and a) write their problem into the forum and wait for a response or read other people’s responses or b) select a date on the calendar that a FirstClass expert can help them on.
* Viewing Emails on Time -  the notifications and announcement icons on the top of the website allow for students to be notified quickly of important news. The cycling aspect of the news banner makes the news very visible and the first thing users will check when they open the resource page. 
* Improving Communication (pgs. 2-4) - improve communication through more ways to communicate and assistance doing so. Page 2 allows for an expanded view of how to get contact information for any kind of contact you would need, page 3 allows for a smooth announcement system which affords users to communicate with the whole community at once, and page 4 allows for a more streamlined club chatting system that is not as formal and one-sided as email announcements.
* Launching the Application - This is improved through thorough help guides on page 1 and assistance pages 5-6. All a user has to do is look through the videos on page 1 to find a tutorial for what they need or just repeat the steps for Fixing Problems on pages 5-6 if they run into trouble.



## DESIGN 2: FirstClass Replacement

![crepe](/assets/img/lukedesign.jpg)

The redesign of FirstClass is, on a very basic level, a fusion of HM’s old system, Haiku, and FirstClass. Because it is a program strictly for the HM community, there is no need for a login and a mail server - all you need is a google account, which is already provided by the school. It has the mail system from FirstClass, a homework calendar, a notification board for clubs or assessments, and a direct messaging system. The mail system is essentially the same as FirstClass, but has two added features. Users will have the ability to save or mark emails so they can view them later if needed. Finding and viewing past emails is easier if they are marked by a user, and they cannot be lost if saved by the user. A user can also attach multiple files at once instead of needing to attach them individually. Attaching files is a problem because new users of FirstClass may not be able to find the icon that opens up the menu for attaching files. This indicator will be larger, and being able to attach multiple files at once will make the process much faster.  Any homework assignments and dropboxes are condensed in a calendar so it’s easier for students to manage their work, and a notification board appears on the front page of the website so students will not miss anything important. Furthermore, the website will have a direct messaging system for quicker, informal communications. Similar to text messages on a phone, a user will see notifications on the front page of the website and will also be able to attach files to messages. This should make communication much easier and much faster. A notification board and a messaging system highlight more important emails while any informal emails can be sent through the direct messaging system, which is much easier to read than the traditional email system.

## DESIGN 3: FirstClass Redesign

This design is a complete redesign of the first class interface and its functionalities. The tasks that this design focuses on is troubleshooting, attaching files, expediting (and making more efficient) communication with students for teachers, and seeing past emails. This design focuses on making tasks as easy as possible to interpret. Essentially, this design works to make the tasks more rudimentary and less complex. Because, if it’s more simple, it’s easier for everyone part of the community to communicate. These descriptions below will describe how the design and each image works. 

  1.	In the first image, there is a redesigned help menu. The help menu in FirstClass is clunky and doesn’t help troubleshoot well. This help menu will have hyperlinks to video tutorials or worded directions to troubleshoot certain problems that people might face. 

  2.	This image has a class database. This is where the “tailored to Horace Mann” aspect of our application comes in. This database will hold a list of all classes at Horace Mann middle/upper (that can be searched through obviously) for teachers to send emails to specific classes easily or even find specific students in their class easily. 

  3.	In this image, this interface targets file attachment specifically. Attaching files on FirstClass is fairly difficult, and this simplifies it by just making it a Drag-and-Drop functionality. 

  4.	This is one of the most important additions to the design. The Mail archive allows for people to search through all the emails they have previously received. The dropdown era will have filters like “the last year” or “the last month” to help users narrow down what they’re looking for.
