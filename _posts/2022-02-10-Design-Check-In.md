## INTRO: AFFINITY DIAGRAM + OUR SIX TASKS

### 1. FirstClass Resource Page

The FirstClass Resource Page is a collection of videos, forums, and resources that can help an experienced or new Horace Mann student/staff member/teacher navigate FirstClass and get into contact with other community members. The first page has a general how-to guide for using FirstClass for the first time, detailing how to log into your account, launch and download the application, and more with student-made video guides. Pages 2 and 4 help users to contact others, allowing them to find emails for members and how to contact them as well as a page dedicated to seamless interaction between clubs and publications through Slack Channels. Page 3 allows students/teachers to submit permission to make an announcement to the whole school or a significant portion of the school. Pages 5 + 6 allow for users to get help with FirstClass and help each other with their day-to-day issues. On the top of all pages, important announcements cycle through so that notifications can be well communicated. Also in the top of most pages there is a mail icon showing how many unread messages there are in your inbox.

The help forums + calendar sign-up pages allow for users to get help for their various issues, the notifications and announcement icons on the top of the website allow for students to be notified quickly, pages 2-4 improve communication through more ways to communicate and assistance doing so, and launching the application can be helped through thorough help guides on page 1 and assistance pages 5-6.
