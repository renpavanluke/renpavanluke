## DESIGN 1: FirstClass Resource Page

![crepe](/assets/img/rendesign.jpg)

The FirstClass Resource Page is a collection of videos, forums, and resources that can help an experienced or new Horace Mann student/staff member/teacher navigate FirstClass and get into contact with other community members. The first page has a general how-to guide for using FirstClass for the first time, detailing how to log into your account, launch and download the application, and more with student-made video guides. Pages 2 and 4 help users to contact others, allowing them to find emails for members and how to contact them as well as a page dedicated to seamless interaction between clubs and publications through Slack Channels. Page 3 allows students/teachers to submit permission to make an announcement to the whole school or a significant portion of the school. Pages 5 + 6 allow for users to get help with FirstClass and help each other with their day-to-day issues. On the top of all pages, important announcements cycle through so that notifications can be well communicated. Also in the top of most pages there is a mail icon showing how many unread messages there are in your inbox.


This Design allows users to: 
* Fixing Problems (pgs. 5-6) - The help forums + calendar sign-up pages allow for users to get help for their various issues. All they have to do is click on the page and a) write their problem into the forum and wait for a response or read other people’s responses or b) select a date on the calendar that a FirstClass expert can help them on.
* Viewing Emails on Time -  the notifications and announcement icons on the top of the website allow for students to be notified quickly of important news. The cycling aspect of the news banner makes the news very visible and the first thing users will check when they open the resource page. 
* Improving Communication (pgs. 2-4) - improve communication through more ways to communicate and assistance doing so. Page 2 allows for an expanded view of how to get contact information for any kind of contact you would need, page 3 allows for a smooth announcement system which affords users to communicate with the whole community at once, and page 4 allows for a more streamlined club chatting system that is not as formal and one-sided as email announcements.
* Launching the Application - This is improved through thorough help guides on page 1 and assistance pages 5-6. All a user has to do is look through the videos on page 1 to find a tutorial for what they need or just repeat the steps for Fixing Problems on pages 5-6 if they run into trouble.



## DESIGN 2: FirstClass Redesign

![crepe](/assets/img/lukedesign.jpg)

The redesign of FirstClass is, on a very basic level, a fusion of HM’s old system, Haiku, and FirstClass. Because it is a program strictly for the HM community, there is no need for a login and a mail server - all you need is a google account, which is already provided by the school. It has the mail system from FirstClass, a homework calendar, a notification board for clubs or assessments, and a direct messaging system. The mail system is essentially the same as FirstClass, but has two added features. Users will have the ability to save or mark emails so they can view them later if needed. Finding and viewing past emails is easier if they are marked by a user, and they cannot be lost if saved by the user. A user can also attach multiple files at once instead of needing to attach them individually. Attaching files is a problem because new users of FirstClass may not be able to find the icon that opens up the menu for attaching files. This indicator will be larger, and being able to attach multiple files at once will make the process much faster.  Any homework assignments and dropboxes are condensed in a calendar so it’s easier for students to manage their work, and a notification board appears on the front page of the website so students will not miss anything important. Furthermore, the website will have a direct messaging system for quicker, informal communications. Similar to text messages on a phone, a user will see notifications on the front page of the website and will also be able to attach files to messages. This should make communication much easier and much faster. A notification board and a messaging system highlight more important emails while any informal emails can be sent through the direct messaging system, which is much easier to read than the traditional email system.

## DESIGN 3: FirstClass Redesign 2

This design is a complete redesign of the first class interface and its functionalities. The tasks that this design focuses on is troubleshooting, attaching files, expediting (and making more efficient) communication with students for teachers, and seeing past emails. This design focuses on making tasks as easy as possible to interpret. Essentially, this design works to make the tasks more rudimentary and less complex. Because, if it’s more simple, it’s easier for everyone part of the community to communicate. These descriptions below will describe how the design and each image works. 

  1.	In the first image, there is a redesigned help menu. The help menu in FirstClass is clunky and doesn’t help troubleshoot well. This help menu will have hyperlinks to video tutorials or worded directions to troubleshoot certain problems that people might face. 

  2.	This image has a class database. This is where the “tailored to Horace Mann” aspect of our application comes in. This database will hold a list of all classes at Horace Mann middle/upper (that can be searched through obviously) for teachers to send emails to specific classes easily or even find specific students in their class easily. 

  3.	In this image, this interface targets file attachment specifically. Attaching files on FirstClass is fairly difficult, and this simplifies it by just making it a Drag-and-Drop functionality. 

  4.	This is one of the most important additions to the design. The Mail archive allows for people to search through all the emails they have previously received. The dropdown era will have filters like “the last year” or “the last month” to help users narrow down what they’re looking for.
