### OUR 2 CENTRAL TASKS

1. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)
2. Finding/Viewing Past Emails

### INTRO PARAGRAPH 
After receiving the critique feedback and reviewing our previous UX research, we came to the conclusion that the most important tasks FirstClass should perform is the ability to a) communicate (i.e. sending emails, announcements, club discussions), and b) find the important emails(like announcements or information). We found that the best way to accomplish these two tasks through the FirstClass program would be to incorporate elements of all three sample designs, ensuring that people a) had access to new features that would afford and therefore improve communication(i.e. slack forms for emails, announcement forums, direct messaging, etc.) and also solve problems with previous email functions (i.e. poor/lack of email filtering, inefficient auto-deletion, and difficulty with basic software). We know these are major issues since our critiques stressed their concern for a change in the structure of the mail archive, and from our UX data users stressed how hard it was for them to find past emails and get into contact with their teachers/students/colleagues. This design is best suited for our users (the HM community) because it mimics other programs that HMers use like haiku and google. By having similar features/functions to other modern programs a wider range of people will be able to use it. It also incorporates new functions that cater to tasks that students/teachers have everyday like contacting clubs, communicating informally with other students, and finding past emails.  
The two tasks that we’ve decided to focus on are Efficient Communication and Access to Emails from the past. 
Efficient Communication – is clearly crucial to the core of an email system. Teachers, students, and even faculty reported struggling with this task in the current FirstClass, and communication is of course the entire purpose of emailing. This task is afforded in our new design through the several new features that allow students and teachers to contact each other more informally and quickly. This can be seen in the Club Slack Page(3), the Direct Message Function(2), and the easy-access announcement/meeting request/forms Page (4). 
Access to Emails from the Past - is extremely crucial in the setting of a school environment, with important information, forms, and resources being sent via email constantly. Our survey respondents from our Contextual Inquiries reported struggling with finding these emails nearly daily, with roughly 82% of users saying that they struggled with this aspect of the application. Our design supports this issue by incorporating a new email filtering system that sorts certain unimportant messages into spam (i.e. nytimes emails, classroom emails, etc.) and deletes after 30 days, whilst automatically storing all information based emails and email conversations.
