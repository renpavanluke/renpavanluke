### OUR 2 CENTRAL TASKS

1. Improving Communication (sending emails, announcements)
2. Finding/Viewing Past Emails

### INTRO PARAGRAPH 
This design is best suited for our users (the HM community) because it mimics other programs that HMers use like haiku and google. By having similar features/functions to other modern programs a wider range of people will be able to use it. It also incorporates new functions that cater to tasks that students/teachers have everyday like contacting clubs, communicating informally with other students, and finding past emails. So, for our design, we came to the consensus that all of our three designs should be meshed together, because of how our design all addressed different aspects and functionalities that we all identified as a group weeks ago. The two tasks that weâ€™ve decided to focus on are efficient communication and being able to see a database of emails from the past. This is because these are the two tasks that we identified as the most pertinent to the school population from our analysis of the school population survey. The tasks we picked are more crucial than the others because they capture the central idea of any emailing system - to communicate with others and view things that people have sent you.
