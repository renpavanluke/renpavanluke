## Group Proposal 

One major problem that Horace Mann has is it’s email system, Firstclass. Firstclass is used daily by teachers and students, and the inconveniences that we experience become very inconvenient for the community. Firstclass has proven to be unreliable for sending and receiving emails. An unreliable email system disrupts the communication between students and teachers, which creates more stress in learning. Firstclass also has a function that auto deletes emails, so it will be impossible for a member of the community to find an email that they need that was sent to them a month ago. Firstclass also isn’t very user friendly. The interface is confusing for new users and is much more difficult to use than other email systems. This creates a large disconnect in the ability for members of the community to interact with one another, and access information that could engage them more within the community.

One of the positive aspects of Horace Mann’s FirstClass communication system is that it serves as a personalized platform for Horace Mann as a whole schooling institution, which is something we definitely want to keep. This is so beneficial because it means that everything to do with the school is all in one place, and, if done correctly, would make it very easy for anyone in the community to operate it and communicate in the ways they need to. However, due to the shortfallings of the application, this is not possible. For example, when I first joined the school last year I had a very hard time using first class, with me not knowing how to log in at all for the first 6 months of the year. This led me to miss a lot of emails and information because I did not understand how the system worked. When I tried to solve my issue, I was sent a series of google docs detailing how the system worked, but they were confusing and long, which made it near impossible to use. Of course having a help guide at all was a good start, but designing the help page to be helpful to someone that has never used the application before should’ve been a priority. 

## Contextual Inquiry Plan 

First Class is used by everyone in the Horace Mann community in order to communicate with each other, plan events and club meetings, and more. So the best way to get an idea of how Firstclass impacts us all is to get a variety of users, which is two students of different familiarity with firstclass as well as a teacher who needs to communicate with their students. Our first participant would be a freshman or new student who had never used firstclass before this year. This could help us get information on how firstclass works for someone that has never used the application before, and how user friendly it is for people trying to work it for the first time. Next, a senior or upperclassman that has been using first class for many years, who would understand what worked well with the application and also be able to explain what they struggle with on a daily basis. Finally we would want to interview a teacher who is tasked with sending reminders, making meetings, and just generally interacting with the community. This would add the additional viewpoint of someone who might not be as familiar with technology like a student would be. We would conduct these experiments through interviews or questionnaires/surveys so that they could communicate the specific issues or strong points of first class and how that effects their life, something other research methods wouldn’t allow.
