## OUR 3 TESTS
1. #### a new freshman (Allison)

The first test was with a new freshman robotics student, taking place during robotics practice after school. We specifically chose this environment since long robotics practices are a good time for a student to use our on-the-go mobile FirstClass. To conduct the test, I pulled Allison aside and sat him down in front of the interface for the app. I then served as both the proctor and computer, which was a purposeful choice since it made the test feel a little less staged and more organic to how the user would actually be using the app. This user responded very well with the design since they were a frequent gmail, slack, google classroom, and general technology user. They immediately understood the log-in, navigation, and organization of the app. They completed all three tasks with ease, except for the one incident where they did not recognize the slack logo due to poor drawing skills. This was resolved when they navigated to another page and found a better drawn icon. To ensure no one would struggle with the slack icon again, we added a pop-up when you first entered the app to inform the user that the icon of slack was the club page of the app.


2. #### a returning junior (Jack)

The alias that this tester chose was Jack. He is a Junior high school student who is pretty familiar with the ins and outs of technology in general. He joined Horace Mann in the 6th grade and thus, has had a good amount of time to get familiar with First Class. We chose this participant to get another perspective of a longtime student at Horace Mann. The tasks we gave this participant were to, Login, Email a teacher to arrange a meeting, and check when the Game Jam Club meets next. I (Pavan) was the proctor, and Ren recorded observations. The tester executed the tasks fairly quickly and smoothly, however the tester seemed to take the less efficient routes to pages sometimes. Yet, it seemed to him that the design was easy to understand and intuitive. The only change we made out of this test was adding a more defined label for the slack icon. 

3. #### a teacher (Mr. Grunebaum)

Our participant for our third and final usability test was a staff member from the computer science department, SG. He joined Horace Mann very recently but is very familiar with technology and the process of usability testing so using FirstClass is not usually an issue for him. We chose this participant because we thought it would be useful to have the perspective of a staff member who is older than other participants and his background in technology gives very unique insight on our prototype. Two of our team members participated in the test: Luke, who played the role of the “computer” and Ren, who was the proctor. During our test, we had SG perform the tasks of signing into the app, sending an email to a student, and checking when certain clubs would happen using Slack. We did not make any revisions to our process before this test, but since some of the tasks were performed with some difficulty, we changed the prototype by making the settings icon clearer, creating a help page, adding a “save draft” function, and adding an “x” to many windows to make a clearer signifier on how to close it.

## IMPORTANT REVISIONS / EXPLANATION OF INCIDENTS TABLE
1. #### Help Page

2. #### Slack Icon

3. #### Exit Buttons / Save Unfinished Emails

The exit button issue proved to be a major issue since being confident in the navigation of the app is essential to having a good experience with it. It also was important to pick up on this issue since the issue of saving drafts is something we don’t generally think about as students. Detecting more teacher/staff based issues/needs is a major concern for our design, especially since teachers use FirstClass more than any other group on campus. To go into more detail on the incident, our participant Mr. SG was unable to exit out of pop-ups (ex. slack/GC pop-up at beginning), or to save a draft of his email he was sending to his failing student. This worried him because he expressed that he often saved all his emails before he sent them so he could update and revise them prior to sending.
