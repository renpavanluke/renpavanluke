## Summary of Key Findings

Throughout our UX research, we found that the community struggled greatly with using the current FirstClass, which increased general frustration as well as prevented effective and reliable communication. These issues affect teachers/administrators who have to make announcements and communicate with colleagues + students, as well as students who were unable to access important news and find past important emails. FirstClass also largely impacted new students who felt lost and confused whilst using the app, with data showing that near to 100% of them struggled with FirstClass “a few times a day.”

## Contextual Inquiry Participants

In order to get a wide range of experiences, we interviewed an experienced HM student who had been using FirstClass for 3 years, a teacher who had been at the school for a long time, as well as sending out a survey to a portion of the Horace Mann community which gathered experiences from a variety of community members. We chose these three because we wanted to understand the experienced perspectives of users who knew and understood FirstClass and used it everyday. 

First we interviewed and conducted a UX inquiry with freshman “Bob” who had been using FirstClass for 3 years. During the UX Inquiry, Bob noted that the app was slow compared to other email platforms. Opening new emails took more time than it should have, and downloading and attaching a .pdf file was extremely slow. Another problem that he identified was if an email was deleted. If someone were to send an email and then delete it, the person who received the email would still see it in their mailbox. After opening the email, an error message would pop up, and the recipient would have to re-open their mailbox. Only then would the email be deleted from their system. This wasted a lot of time for Bob because he had multiple deleted emails in his mailbox. Bob also shared how much he struggled with this platform when he was a new user, especially due to its complexity and badly organized display of features. However, Bob also identified some functions in FirstClass that were very helpful, which were the autocomplete system and “next unread” button that FirstClass has. When entering an email address to a recipient, FirstClass can find users with a Horace Mann email if a user just searches their name. If someone does not know the full name of their teacher, they can find their email address using this function. If a user is viewing an email, they can quickly see their next email that is marked unread by hitting the “next” unread button. Both functions saved a lot of time for Bob. As you can tell from the wide range of information, Bob felt very comfortable in the interview and was able to share his experiences transparently and effortlessly. 
 
After that, we interviewed experienced teacher Mr. B. Mr. B shared how although he felt that he knew the technology in FirstClass extremely well, he was still unable to trust and rely on it for his work. He noted announcements and important emails that had failed to send or not saved correctly, and how he struggled with that frequently, which is more than you would expect with other email sites. Once again we felt that the interviewing environment was comfortable because we chose a teacher we knew well and interviewed them in a location they felt comfortable in.
 
Next we chose to send out a form to members of the community to get a wide range of inputs. This, unfortunately, went the worst out of the three research opportunities because we were unable to get permission to send it out to the whole school and therefore were limited to a heavy user bias. Most of our participants were in our App Development class and therefore were biased, and they were also mostly students. Although we have a diverse range of grades in our class, most of our recipients were also long-time users, with only 2 being new to FirstClass this year. Our main takeaways from our slightly unreliable survey were that most experienced people struggled with FirstClass at least once a week and people that had been using FirstClass for less than a year struggled with it a few times a day, major issues were finding past emails and reading emails on time, liked functions were the auto-fill feature and the next unread feature, and a disliked feature was the automatic deletion. 
 
 
## Contextual Inquiry Themes and Process
 
One of our main focuses while conducting our UX research was making sure our interviewee felt comfortable. This meant interviewing them in places that they hung out a lot, and following them as they did their general, everyday tasks. 
 
For freshman Bob, we positioned the interview on the second floor of the library, and he used his own computer to show us around. We asked Bob to open the app and do what he would usually do upon opening the app. Afterwards we asked him to send an email with a file attached, forward an email, and view/download a file from an email. From the inquiry we learned that someone who has been using the platform for a while can do most operations in the app without much thought, while a new user may have to spend time looking for things on the platform. For example, the mailbox, which, for Bob, is the function he uses most in FirstClass, has a tiny link that the user needs to click on in order to open it. Bob clicked on this link nearly instantly after the page loaded and knew exactly where to find it. A new user may have to spend some time looking for smaller signifiers in the app, which may waste time for someone unfamiliar with the app. 
 
When conducting our interview with teacher Mr. B, we made sure to schedule with a teacher we already had a comfortable relationship with so that they would provide honest and casual responses to asked questions. This was to better the attempt at a relation-based comfort for the interviewee for the interview-style research rather than UX which is supposed to be more analytical. This strategy worked very well and provided us with the issues and advantages of FirstClass for this teacher everyday. Mr. B in particular stressed his annoyance with his inability to work FirstClass despite his years of experience, which shows a great deal of frustration that seems to run high in all our research thus far. We also got to hear about his issues with having to constantly send out announcements and emails, and since as a teacher he has to do this so much more than the average student, he was much more affected by these issues.

We tried our best to conduct our third research with comfort by creating a short, simple, multiple choice poll that we wanted to send out to anyone that volunteered to take it. We also made it anonymous so that people would feel more comfortable sharing their opinions. Our high level findings were people constantly struggling with the application, especially newcomers who said that they struggled “a few times a day,” which is concerningly high for someone who uses this application to get all their announcements and communication. We also discovered that there were some features that many people felt were unnecessary/they never used, whilst there were other features or functions we suggested or their input that they think would increase their productivity and understanding of the application. Additionally, in our “Any other comments or thoughts?” section there was an overwhelming negativity, with one commenter saying FirstClass was “really bad. 0/17 would not recommend. dogwater” and another claiming they liked “literally nothing” about it.

The high level themes noticed here is the general theme of hatred and incompatibility with FirstClass, especially regarding features central to the community like communication and announcements. There was also a plea for new/deleting features that accommodated (or did not meet) user needs, like the auto-delete feature or a feature that made announcements more accessible. There was also a huge issue with newer users who seemed to be at a complete loss when it came to using the app, with no way of being able to figure it out themselves. 

** Amendment 

After submitting this review, we were able to send out our UX Survey to the entire Upper Division student body + staff. This went incredibly well, with nearly 300 users filling the survey out with their thoughts and experiences. About 78% of our surveyees were students, 19% were teachers, and 3% were staff. The majority of the surveyees had been at the school for over 4 years. Of this user base, 63% struggled with FirstClass at least a few times a week, and 82% struggled to find past important emails. 56% struggled to get notifications/ receive emails on time, and an alarming 42% struggled to merely open the application. When it comes to features, 80% liked the autofill for emails/names function, but only 9% enjoyed the automatically deleting function. When we asked people their thoughts or concerns after the survey, they responded angrily. One staff member said “This system is so shockingly antiquated and fails to integrate with any calendar functions that I couldn't believe it when I joined HM over [a few] years ago. I never thought I would miss Microsoft Outlook as some sort of advanced system, but here we are. Why can't we have gmail based accounts?” An agreeing student said there is “no reason not to switch to a better email service.” One frustrated teacher even fumed that “I also hate the noise it makes. I hate that you can't get a notification on your phone when you get an email. I hate how glitchy it is. I hate how when you get a new email in a thread it doesn't automatically bump the thread to the top. I hate that it automatically deletes emails…” In my time reviewing the responses, I could not find one positive review, none noting the upsides of having a personalized email system. Of course, this could be due to survey bias, as the people who took the time to say something clearly were the ones most passionate about the issue, but regardless these results show an almost ⅓ (?) portion of the community being unhappy.
