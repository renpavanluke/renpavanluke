## INTRO: AFFINITY DIAGRAM + OUR SIX TASKS

![crepe](/assets/img/affinitydiagram.png)

Our Affinity Diagram displays the everyday tasks and issues of our UX research-ees, specifically in terms of their struggles as everyday FirstClass users. Considering their experiences, we’ve devised six major tasks that describe the major elements of FirstClass use for a HM community member, which are checking emails (i.e. getting notifications, announcements, and reading unread emails), launching the application (especially considering 42% of surveyee’s struggled to do this), sending an email (i.e. contacting others, making announcements, replying to emails), attaching/opening files, finding/viewing past emails (i.e. important information, history feature), and lastly fixing problems (what users can do when things go wrong).

## OUR SIX TASKS 

### 1. Checking Emails
**Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Checking emails is the most fundamental function of an email system, and is quite simple in FirstClass. A user will simply go to their mailbox and click on the desired email. There is also a “next unread” function which will send a user to their next unread email. However, 56.4% of users described having problems reading emails on time and receiving notification. This, in reality, should be an easier task, and the data collected in the survey may be due to human error, not the interface of FirstClass.


### 2. Launching the Application
** Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Users launch FirstClass constantly throughout everyday, yet a shocking 42.5% of our surveyees described struggling to do so. When launching the application, a user should tap on the app icon, type in their username and password, and then type in the mail.horacemann.org server ID. The average consistent user should have the mail server ID saved on their computer as well, which helps to streamline the process. We noted this was Easy-Medium, although this should be the easiest task in the process.


### 3. Sending an email (contacting others, announcement, replying)
** Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Sending emails is arguably the most important element of FirstClass, which thankfully seems to run relatively smoothly. 80% of students surveyed reported that they could easily find emails for people they needed to contact, and only 14.7% of users struggled to contact others on FirstClass. However, our resident interviewed teacher struggled a lot with emailing others, feeling that since he used the email function so often he had issues more often. He detailed not being able to send important emails and therefore not trusting that his emails would be received constantly. Currently sending an email works by selecting the mail icon, pressing “new” under another mail icon, typing in your subject, recipient, and cc, and then typing your message. You can send an email with the icon on the top left. 

	
### 4. Attaching/Opening Files to Emails
** Difficulty: Medium

Quite frequently, a user may need to attach a file to an email or open an attached file. This file might be homework, directions for an assignment, or an assessment, so it’s quite important to have a reliable email system so these files don’t get lost through sending. To attach a file, a user will find the button with a link icon, and simply upload their file. According to our survey, 45.8% of participants find that they have issues with sending or receiving files. A frequent problem for some users was that the files attached to an email couldn’t be viewed by the reader, so most of the time the issue isn’t attaching the files, but sending them.


### 5. Finding/Viewing Past Emails
** Difficulty: Hard

82 percent of users had issues with finding past emails. If you want to find a previously viewed email, the best way to find it would be to search the sender of the email’s name in the search bar of your mailbox. For a new user, this isn’t obscure, but for someone who isn’t very experienced with technology it might be confusing to locate the search bar. Also, this isn’t very effective because a user may remember the contents of an email, not the sender. Furthermore, FirstClass has a function which auto-deletes emails after a month in order to save space. Deleted emails are saved in the “trash” section for another month, and are then lost forever. So, it would be impossible to find an email from 2 months or longer ago. 90% of users didn’t find this function useful, and many instead said that it was rather annoying.


### 6. Fixing Problems 
** Difficulty: Hard

When things with FirstClass do not go smoothly (which happens to 62% of users at least once a week), it’s essential that a user can find out how to get help and continue on with the application effortlessly. Currently, if you had a problem with FirstClass you could contact someone from the Tech Department or go on the UD Student Life Page and access the FirstClass section. However, this is hard to access because a user could not know anyone on the Tech team, and the FirstClass page on the UD Student Life page only has one resource, which is a brief google doc link. This makes help extremely difficult, especially for newer students who might not have access to a wide range of knowledge on how to get help.
